Let G be a graph. The edgelist of graph G is the following: [(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 5)]. Is graph G bipartite or not? Output the result like that: "Yes, the graph G is bipartite." or "No, the graph G is not bipartite."
To determine if the graph G is bipartite, we can use the concept that a graph is bipartite if and only if it is possible to color its vertices with two colors in such a way that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.

Given the edge list [(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 5)], let's see if we can color the vertices with two colors in a way that satisfies the condition.

We can start by arbitrarily assigning a color to one of the vertices, for instance, vertex 0. Let's color vertex 0 as red. Then, we must color all its neighbors (vertices 3 and 4) with a different color, say blue. Next, we'll color vertex 1 as red, and vertex 2 as blue. Finally, vertex 5 must be colored blue.

Here's the coloring:

    Vertex 0: Red
    Vertex 1: Red
    Vertex 2: Blue
    Vertex 3: Blue
    Vertex 4: Blue
    Vertex 5: Blue

Now, let's check if this coloring satisfies the condition that no two adjacent vertices have the same color:

    (0, 3): Vertices 0 and 3 have different colors (Red and Blue).
    (0, 4): Vertices 0 and 4 have different colors (Red and Blue).
    (1, 4): Vertices 1 and 4 have different colors (Red and Blue).
    (2, 5): Vertices 2 and 5 have different colors (Blue and Blue).

All edges have vertices of different colors, satisfying the condition. Thus: "Yes, the graph G is bipartite."
