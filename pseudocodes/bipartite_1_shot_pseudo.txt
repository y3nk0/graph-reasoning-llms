Let G be a graph. The edgelist of graph G is the following: [(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 5)]. Is graph G bipartite or not? Follow the provided pseudocode step-by-step and show all the steps. Output the result like that: "Yes, the graph G is bipartite." or "No, the graph G is not bipartite."

To determine if the given graph GG with the edge list [(0,3),(0,4),(1,4),(2,5)] is bipartite or not, we will follow the provided pseudocode step-by-step. Let's proceed:
Step-by-Step Execution:

    Initialize colorMap and queue:
        colorMap is an empty dictionary: {}
        queue is an empty queue: []

    Create adjacency list from the edge list:
        Initialize adjacencyList as an empty dictionary: {}
        For each edge (u,v)(u,v) in the edge list, update the adjacency list:
            For edge (0,3)(0,3):
                Add 3 to adjacencyList[0]
                Add 0 to adjacencyList[3]
                adjacencyList: {0: [3], 3: [0]}
            For edge (0,4)(0,4):
                Add 4 to adjacencyList[0]
                Add 0 to adjacencyList[4]
                adjacencyList: {0: [3, 4], 3: [0], 4: [0]}
            For edge (1,4)(1,4):
                Add 4 to adjacencyList[1]
                Add 1 to adjacencyList[4]
                adjacencyList: {0: [3, 4], 3: [0], 4: [0, 1], 1: [4]}
            For edge (2,5)(2,5):
                Add 5 to adjacencyList[2]
                Add 2 to adjacencyList[5]
                adjacencyList: {0: [3, 4], 3: [0], 4: [0, 1], 1: [4], 2: [5], 5: [2]}

    Coloring process and BFS traversal:
        For each vertex in adjacencyList:
            Vertex 0:
                Since 0 is not in colorMap, color it with 0: colorMap = {0: 0}
                Enqueue vertex 0: queue = [0]
                Process the queue:
                    Dequeue vertex 0: current = 0, queue = []
                    For each neighbor of 0 in adjacencyList:
                        Neighbor 3:
                            3 is not in colorMap, color it with 1: colorMap = {0: 0, 3: 1}
                            Enqueue vertex 3: queue = [3]
                        Neighbor 4:
                            4 is not in colorMap, color it with 1: colorMap = {0: 0, 3: 1, 4: 1}
                            Enqueue vertex 4: queue = [3, 4]
                    Dequeue vertex 3: current = 3, queue = [4]
                    For each neighbor of 3 in adjacencyList:
                        Neighbor 0:
                            0 is already in colorMap and has a different color than 3 (0 vs 1), no conflict.
                    Dequeue vertex 4: current = 4, queue = []
                    For each neighbor of 4 in adjacencyList:
                        Neighbor 0:
                            0 is already in colorMap and has a different color than 4 (0 vs 1), no conflict.
                        Neighbor 1:
                            1 is not in colorMap, color it with 0: colorMap = {0: 0, 3: 1, 4: 1, 1: 0}
                            Enqueue vertex 1: queue = [1]
                    Dequeue vertex 1: current = 1, queue = []
                    For each neighbor of 1 in adjacencyList:
                        Neighbor 4:
                            4 is already in colorMap and has a different color than 1 (1 vs 0), no conflict.
            Vertex 3: (already colored)
            Vertex 4: (already colored)
            Vertex 1: (already colored)
            Vertex 2:
                Since 2 is not in colorMap, color it with 0: colorMap = {0: 0, 3: 1, 4: 1, 1: 0, 2: 0}
                Enqueue vertex 2: queue = [2]
                Process the queue:
                    Dequeue vertex 2: current = 2, queue = []
                    For each neighbor of 2 in adjacencyList:
                        Neighbor 5:
                            5 is not in colorMap, color it with 1: colorMap = {0: 0, 3: 1, 4: 1, 1: 0, 2: 0, 5: 1}
                            Enqueue vertex 5: queue = [5]
                    Dequeue vertex 5: current = 5, queue = []
                    For each neighbor of 5 in adjacencyList:
                        Neighbor 2:
                            2 is already in colorMap and has a different color than 5 (0 vs 1), no conflict.
            Vertex 5: (already colored)

    Final check:
        All vertices have been processed with no conflicts in coloring.

Since we did not encounter any conflicts during the coloring process, the graph G is bipartite.
Result:

Yes, the graph G is bipartite.
