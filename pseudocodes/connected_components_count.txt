FUNCTION connected_components_count(edgelist):
    INITIALIZE a dictionary to map each vertex to its component label
    INITIALIZE a variable to store the current component label

    FOR EACH vertex IN edgelist:
        IF vertex is not in the dictionary:
            ADD a new entry to the dictionary with vertex as the key and current component label as the value
            INCREMENT the current component label

    FOR EACH edge (vertex1, vertex2) IN edgelist:
        component1 = the component label of vertex1
        component2 = the component label of vertex2

        IF component1 is not equal to component2:
            UPDATE the dictionary to merge the two components into a single component with the smaller label

    RETURN the number of unique component labels in the dictionary
