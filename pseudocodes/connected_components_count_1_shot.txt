Let G be a graph. The edgelist of graph G is the following: [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (0, 2), (4, 5)]. What is the number of connected components of G?
Given the edge list [(0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,0),(0,2),(4,5)] for graph G, we need to determine the number of connected components. First, let's examine the connections implied by the edges:
Graph Structure Analysis

The edges create the following connections between vertices:

    0 connects to 1, 3, and 2
    1 connects to 0 and 2
    2 connects to 1, 3, and 0
    3 connects to 2, 0
    4 connects to 5
    5 connects to 4

This structure shows that vertices 0, 1, 2, and 3 form a connected subgraph where each vertex is reachable from any other within this group. Vertices 4 and 5 form a separate connected component, as they are only directly connected to each other and not to any of the vertices in the first group.
Determining Connected Components

From this analysis, we see that:

    Vertices 0, 1, 2, and 3 are in one connected component.
    Vertices 4 and 5 are in another connected component.

Since these groups are isolated from each other, we conclude:

    There are two connected components in graph G.

Thus, the number of connected components in G is: 2
