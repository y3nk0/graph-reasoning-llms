FUNCTION connected_components_count(edgelist):
    INITIALIZE a dictionary to map each vertex to its component label
    INITIALIZE a variable to store the current component label

    FOR EACH vertex IN edgelist:
        IF vertex is not in the dictionary:
            ADD a new entry to the dictionary with vertex as the key and current component label as the value
            INCREMENT the current component label

    FOR EACH edge (vertex1, vertex2) IN edgelist:
        component1 = the component label of vertex1
        component2 = the component label of vertex2

Let G be a graph. The edgelist of graph G is the following: [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (0, 2), (4, 5)]. What is the number of connected components of G? Follow the provided pseudocode step-by-step and show all steps. Output the result like that: The number of connected components is...

To determine the number of connected components of graph G using the provided pseudocode, we will follow the steps given and iterate through the process using the edgelist [(0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,0),(0,2),(4,5)]. This pseudocode describes a unique approach and seems to be an attempt at a Union-Find algorithm. Nonetheless, let's simulate based on the provided steps:
Step 1: Initialize Component Labels

We'll begin by assigning each vertex an initial component label:

    Create an empty dictionary to hold each vertex and its component label.
    Initialize a variable for the current component label starting from 0.

For each vertex in the edgelist:

0 -> Component 0
1 -> Component 1
2 -> Component 2
3 -> Component 3
4 -> Component 4
5 -> Component 5

Initial dictionary after this step:

{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 5}
(Note: Each vertex is initially in its own component.)

Step 2: Merge Components Based on Edges

For each edge, merge the components if they are different:

    We need to compare the components of each pair and unify them if they differ.

Process each edge:

    For (0, 1):
        Components are 0 and 1. Since they are different, unify to the smaller label (0).
        Update: 1 component becomes 0.
        Update dictionary: {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 5}

    For (1, 2) (now both 0 and 2):
        Components are 0 and 2. Unify to 0.
        Update dictionary: {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 5}

    For (2, 3) (now 0, 1, 2, and 3 are all connected):
        Components are 0 and 3. Unify to 0.
        Update dictionary: {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 4, 5: 5}

    For (3, 0) (all these are already 0):
        Already unified.

    For (0, 2):
        Already unified.

    For (4, 5):
        Components are 4 and 5. Unify to 4.
        Update dictionary: {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 4, 5: 4}

Step 3: Count Unique Components

Count the number of unique component labels in the dictionary:

    {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 4, 5: 4} has two unique components (0 and 4).

Conclusion
The number of connected components is 2.
