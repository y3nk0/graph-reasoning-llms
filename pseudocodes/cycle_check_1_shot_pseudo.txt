Let G be a graph. The edgelist of graph G is the following: [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4)]. Is there a cycle in G? Follow the provided pseudocode step-by-step and show all steps. Output the result like that: "There is a cycle" or "There is no cycle."

To determine if there is a cycle in the graph G using the provided pseudocode, we will follow the steps and maintain intermediate states.
Input

The edge list of the graph GG is:
[(0,1),(0,2),(1,2),(1,3),(3,4)]
Step 1: Initialize Structures

    nodes: []
    neighbors: {}

Step 2: Construct the Adjacency List from the Edge List

For edge (0,1):

    vertex=0,other_vertex=1
        neighbors[0]=[1], nodes=[0]
    vertex=1,other_vertex=0
        neighbors[1]=[0], nodes=[0,1]

For edge (0,2):

    vertex=0,other_vertex=2
        neighbors[0]=[1,2]
    vertex=2,other_vertex=0
        neighbors[2]=[0], nodes=[0,1,2]

For edge (1,2):

    vertex=1,other_vertex=2
        neighbors[1]=[0,2]
    vertex=2,other_vertex=1
        neighbors[2]=[0,1]

For edge (1,3):

    vertex=1,other_vertex=3v
        neighbors[1]=[0,2,3]
    vertex=3,other_vertex=1
        neighbors[3]=[1], nodes=[0,1,2,3]

For edge (3,4):

    vertex=3,other_vertex=4
        neighbors[3]=[1,4]
    vertex=4,other_vertex=3
        neighbors[4]=[3], nodes=[0,1,2,3,4]

Adjacency List

    nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    neighbors: {0: [1, 2], 1: [0, 2, 3], 2: [0, 1], 3: [1, 4], 4: [3]}

Step 3: Initialize Visited Set

    visited: {}

Step 4: Check for Cycles
For node 0 (not visited):

    queue: [0]
    connected: []
    visited: {0}

BFS from node 0:

    current_node: 0
        connected: [0]
        queue: [1, 2] (neighbors of 0)
        visited: {0, 1, 2}

    current_node: 2
        connected: [0, 2]
        queue: [1] (remaining neighbor of 2 is already visited)

    current_node: 1
        connected: [0, 2, 1]
        queue: [3] (remaining neighbor of 1 is 3)
        visited: {0, 1, 2, 3}

    current_node: 3
        connected: [0, 2, 1, 3]
        queue: [4] (remaining neighbor of 3 is 4)
        visited: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}

    current_node: 4
        connected: [0, 2, 1, 3, 4]
        queue: []

Sum of Degrees Calculation for Connected Component [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]:

    sum_of_degrees:
        Node 0: 2
        Node 1: 3
        Node 2: 2
        Node 3: 2
        Node 4: 1
        Total: 2+3+2+2+1=10

Number of Edges:

    number_of_edges=10/2=5

Check if Number of Edges Exceeds Nodes Minus One:

    number_of_edges=5
    length_of_connected−1=5−1=4
    5>4⇒True

Since the condition number_of_edges>length_of_connected−1 holds true, there is a cycle in the graph.
Result: There is a cycle
