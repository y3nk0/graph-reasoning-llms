1. Create an empty set called `visited` and an empty list called `cycle`.
2. For each edge `(u, v)` in the edgelist:
   a. If `u` is not in `visited`:
       i. Add `u` to `visited`.
       ii. Recursively call this function on `v`.
   b. If `v` is in `visited` and `v` is not the same as the previous element in the `cycle` list:
       i. Add `u` to the `cycle` list.
       ii. Output "There is a cycle."
       iii. Return.
3. If the `cycle` list is empty, output "There is no cycle."
