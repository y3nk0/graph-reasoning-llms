Function CountEdges(edgeList):
    // Initialize the count of edges
    edgeCount = 0

    // Iterate through the list of edges
    for edge in edgeList:
        // edgeCount increases by 1
        edgeCount = edgeCount + 1

    // Return the total count of edges
    return edgeCount

Let G be a graph. The edgelist of graph G is the following: [(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5), (4, 5)]. What is the number of edges of G? Follow the above pseudocode step-by-step. Output the result like that: The number of edges is ...
To determine the number of edges in the graph G using the provided pseudocode, we'll follow these steps:

1. Initialize the count of edges (edgeCount) to 0.
2. Iterate through the list of edges edgeList.
3. For each edge in edgeList, increment edgeCount by 1.
4. Return the total count of edges.

Let's execute the pseudocode:

edgeList = [(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5), (4, 5)]
edgeCount = 0

// Iteration 1: edge = (0, 1)
edgeCount = 0 + 1 = 1

// Iteration 2: edge = (0, 3)
edgeCount = 1 + 1 = 2

// Iteration 3: edge = (1, 2)
edgeCount = 2 + 1 = 3

// Iteration 4: edge = (1, 4)
edgeCount = 3 + 1 = 4

// Iteration 5: edge = (3, 4)
edgeCount = 4 + 1 = 5

// Iteration 6: edge = (3, 5)
edgeCount = 5 + 1 = 6

// Iteration 7: edge = (2, 5)
edgeCount = 6 + 1 = 7

// Iteration 8: edge = (4, 5)
edgeCount = 7 + 1 = 8

// All edges processed

The number of edges is 8.

So, the number of edges in graph G is 8
