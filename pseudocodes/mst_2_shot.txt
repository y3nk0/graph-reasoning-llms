Let G be a graph. The edgelist of graph G is the following: [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (0, 2)]. What is the minimum spanning tree of G? Output the result as a list.

For finding the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the graph represented by the edge list [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (0, 2)], we follow the conceptual approach of Kruskal's algorithm and avoid creating cycles:

Initialize: Assume every vertex starts in its own set, and prepare to unite these sets as edges are added, ensuring no cycles.

Add Edges:
    Add edge (0, 1). This connects vertex 0 and 1. No cycle is formed.
    Add edge (1, 2). This connects vertex 1 and 2, extending the tree to include vertex 2. No cycle is formed.
    Add edge (2, 3). This connects vertex 2 and 3, extending the tree to include vertex 3. No cycle is formed.

At this point, adding either (3, 0) or (0, 2) would form a cycle:
    (3, 0) would close the cycle with vertices 0-1-2-3-0.
    (0, 2) would close the cycle 0-1-2-0.

Since we've connected all vertices with 3 edges (which is the minimum for a graph with 4 vertices to be connected without forming cycles), we stop here.

Output the MST: The MST edges selected are: [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]

Let G be a graph. The edgelist of graph G is the following: [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5)]. What is the minimum spanning tree of G? Output the result as a list.

A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is a subset of edges in an undirected graph that connects all the vertices with the minimum possible total edge weight. However, the given graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with no weights on the edges, and MST is typically defined for undirected graphs with weights.

To determine an MST for this scenario, we need to make a few adjustments:

    Consider the graph as undirected.
    Assign arbitrary weights to the edges if they are not provided (typically, we assume all edges have equal weight).

Assuming All Edges Have Equal Weight

Given the graph:
[(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5)]

We can use Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm to find the MST. Here we will use Kruskal's algorithm for simplicity since it works well with edge lists.
Kruskal's Algorithm

    Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight (all weights are equal, so we can process them in any order).
    Initialize a union-find structure to keep track of connected components.
    Add edges to the MST one by one, ensuring that no cycles are formed until we have nâˆ’1 edges.

Here are the steps in detail:

    Initialize the MST as an empty set.
    Sort the edges (already sorted due to equal weights).
    Initialize the union-find data structure.
    Process each edge in the sorted list:
        If adding the edge does not form a cycle, add it to the MST.

Steps

    Initialize union-find:
        Parent array: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (each node is its own parent initially)
        Rank array: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

    Process edges:
        Edge (0, 1): Add to MST
        Edge (0, 2): Add to MST
        Edge (1, 3): Add to MST
        Edge (1, 4): Add to MST
        Edge (2, 4): Skip (cycle detected)
        Edge (2, 5): Add to MST
        Edge (3, 5): Skip (cycle detected)

Resulting MST

The edges added to the MST:
[(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5)]
Final MST Edgelist

The minimum spanning tree for the given graph is: [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5)]
