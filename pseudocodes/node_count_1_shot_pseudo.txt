Function CountNodes(EdgeList):
    // EdgeList is a list where each element is a tuple (u, v),
    // indicating an edge between nodes u and v.

    // Initialize a set to store unique nodes

    // Iterate through each edge in the edge list
    For each edge (u, v) in EdgeList:

            Add u to Found

Let G be a graph. The edgelist of graph G is the following: [(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5), (4, 5)]. What is the number of nodes of G? Follow the provided pseudocode step-by-step and show all steps. Output the result like that: The number of nodes is ...
Let's follow the provided pseudocode step-by-step:

    Initialize an empty set Found to store unique nodes.
    Iterate through each edge in the edge list.
    For each edge (u, v):
    a. Check if node u is not in Found, then add u to Found.
    b. Check if node v is not in Found, then add v to Found.
    The size of Found represents the total number of unique nodes.
    Return the size of Found.

Now, let's execute the pseudocode with the given edge list:

EdgeList: [(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5), (4, 5)]

    Initialize Found set: Found = {}
    Iterate through each edge:
        For edge (0, 1):
            0 is not in Found, add 0 to Found. Found = {0}
            1 is not in Found, add 1 to Found. Found = {0, 1}
        For edge (0, 3):
            0 is already in Found.
            3 is not in Found, add 3 to Found. Found = {0, 1, 3}
        For edge (1, 2):
            1 is already in Found.
            2 is not in Found, add 2 to Found. Found = {0, 1, 2, 3}
        For edge (1, 4):
            4 is not in Found, add 4 to Found. Found = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
        For edge (3, 4):
            4 is already in Found.
            3 is already in Found.
        For edge (3, 5):
            5 is not in Found, add 5 to Found. Found = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
        For edge (2, 5):
            5 is already in Found.
            2 is already in Found.
        For edge (4, 5):
            4 is already in Found.
            5 is already in Found.
    After all edges are processed, Found contains all unique nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
    The size of Found is 6, which represents the total number of unique nodes.
    Return 6.

Output: "The number of nodes is 6."
