Let G be a graph. The edgelist of graph G is the following: [(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5), (4, 5)]. What is the degree of node 1? Output the result like that: The degree of the node is ...
To determine the degree of node 1 in the given graph, we count the number of edges incident to node 1.

From the edge list provided, we can see that node 1 is incident to edges (0, 1), (1, 2), and (1, 4). Therefore, the degree of node 1 is 3.

So, the output would be: "The degree of the node is 3."
