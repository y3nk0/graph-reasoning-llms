Function CalculateNodeDegree(EdgeList, Node):
    Initialize degreeCount to 0

    For each edge in EdgeList:
        If Node is edge[0] or Node is edge[1]:
            Increment degreeCount by 1

    Return degreeCount

Let G be a graph. The edgelist of graph G is the following: [(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5), (4, 5)]. What is the degree of node 1? Follow the provided pseudocode step-by-step and show all steps. Output the result like that: The degree of the node is ...

Let's follow the provided pseudocode step-by-step to calculate the degree of node 1 using the given edge list:

    Initialize degreeCount to 0.
    For each edge in the edge list:
    a. Check if the current edge connects to node 1.
    b. If node 1 is either the first or the second node of the edge, increment degreeCount by 1.
    Return degreeCount.

Given edge list: [(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5), (4, 5)].

Let's go through each edge:

    Edge (0, 1): Node 1 is the second node. Increment degreeCount by 1.
        degreeCount = 1
    Edge (0, 3): Node 1 is not part of this edge.
    Edge (1, 2): Node 1 is the first node. Increment degreeCount by 1.
        degreeCount = 2
    Edge (1, 4): Node 1 is the first node. Increment degreeCount by 1.
        degreeCount = 3
    Edge (3, 4): Node 1 is not part of this edge.
    Edge (3, 5): Node 1 is not part of this edge.
    Edge (2, 5): Node 1 is not part of this edge.
    Edge (4, 5): Node 1 is not part of this edge.

After examining all edges, the degreeCount is 3.

So, the output would be: "The degree of the node is 3."
