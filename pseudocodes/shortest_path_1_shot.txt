Let G be a graph. The edgelist of graph G is the following: [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (0, 2)]. Without running what is the shortest path length between nodes 1 and 3? Output the result like that: The shortest path length is ...
To find the shortest path length between node 1 and node 3 in the graph represented by the given edge list, let's manually review the connections:

The edge list provided is:
(0,1)
(1,2)
(2,3)
(3,0)
(0,2)

To find the shortest path from node 1 to node 3, we analyze possible paths:

Starting at node 1, follow the edge
(1,2) and then (2,3).
This path consists of two edges:
1→2→3.
Path length: 2
Checking for possible shorter paths:

There is no direct edge from node 1 to node 3.
No shorter alternative involving a different sequence of edges offers a path length less than 2.
Therefore, the shortest path from node 1 to node 3 traverses two edges, making the path length 2.

Output:
The shortest path length is 2.
