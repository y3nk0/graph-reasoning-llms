Let G be a graph. The edgelist of graph G is the following: [(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5), (4, 5)]. Graph G is a directed acyclic graph. What is the topological sorting of G? Output the result as a list.
To determine a topological sorting of a directed acyclic graph (DAG), we will use Kahn's Algorithm. This algorithm involves tracking the in-degrees (number of incoming edges) of each vertex, and iteratively adding vertices with an in-degree of zero to the sorted list. Here's the step-by-step process to find a topological sort of the graph G given its edge list:

    Identify all vertices and their in-degrees. We count the number of incoming edges for each vertex.
    Initialize a queue with vertices having an in-degree of zero. These vertices do not depend on any other vertices and can be processed first.
    Process the queue: Remove a vertex from the queue, add it to the topological sort result, and decrease the in-degree of its neighboring vertices. If a neighboring vertex's in-degree becomes zero, add it to the queue.
    Repeat until the queue is empty.

Given the edgelist [(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5), (4, 5)], let's perform these steps:
Step 1: Identify vertices and in-degrees

    0: in-degree = 0
    1: in-degree = 1 (from 0)
    2: in-degree = 1 (from 1)
    3: in-degree = 1 (from 0)
    4: in-degree = 2 (from 1, 3)
    5: in-degree = 3 (from 2, 3, 4)

Step 2: Initialize the queue

    Start with vertices 0 and 3 as they both have an in-degree of zero.

Step 3: Process the queue

    Start with 0, add to result; in-degrees of 1 and 3 decrease.
    Then process 3 (since its in-degree was already zero), add to result; in-degrees of 4 and 5 decrease.
    Next is 1, add to result; in-degrees of 2 and 4 decrease.
    Next is 2, add to result; in-degrees of 5 decrease.
    Then 4, add to result; in-degrees of 5 decrease.
    Finally, 5 as its in-degree is now zero.

Step 4: Topological Order

    The topological sorting of G is [0, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5].

Thus, the topological sort of the graph G with the given edge list is [0, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5]
